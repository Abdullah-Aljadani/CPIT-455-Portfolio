Topic: Socio-Technical Systems & Dependability
Case Study: Najm App

1. What I Learned

From this assignment, I learned that software engineering is not only about writing code without bugs. It is about dependability and building trust with users. I also understood that the Najm App is a socio-technical system, where software works together with hardware, people, and real-world processes.

2. Applying the Concepts

I chose availability as the most important attribute because the app must work during accidents. I also considered human errors, such as a stressed driver using the app. I suggested adding an offline mode as a fault tolerance solution in case of internet problems.

3. Challenges

The main challenge was understanding the difference between availability and reliability. Availability means the app is ready to use when needed, while reliability means it works correctly without errors.

4. Personal Growth

This assignment helped me think like a systems engineer, not just a programmer. I now understand the importance of reducing user errors and protecting user data.
