Through completing this assignment, I learned how to connect theoretical concepts of software dependability to real-world applications such as the Najm App. I realized that selecting the appropriate engineering metric, such as POFOD, mainly depends on understanding the system’s usage pattern and its level of criticality. Designing the architectural diagram also helped me better understand how redundancy acts as a strong line of defense, preventing internal faults from becoming visible failures to the user, thus ensuring service continuity during emergency situations.
